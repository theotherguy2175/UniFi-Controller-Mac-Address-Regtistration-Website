<h2>Streaming Devices</h2>

<p><strong>Chromecast / Google Home</strong></p>
<p>Like many college campuses, we do not support these devices, as some features will not work on enterprise networks. We're actively watching any developments in this area, as we'd love to support these in the future.<!--Chromecast will connect to the campus Wi-Fi, but syncing a device with it will be impossible. Basically making a Chromecast impossible to use on the campus Wi-Fi. So therefore, we do not recommend connecting one.--></p>
